**Welcome to FEWD Fundamentals**

---

### Join the Community on Slack!

We design our courses to help you embrace the challenge of lifelong learning. By the end of FEWD, developers should be able to build websites independently, but web development is an ever-changing field. You should also be able to learn new technologies by leveraging various resources.  Those skills take time to develop, though, so we aim to provide support before, during, and after your FEWD course.

You're probably completing the pre-course work at home or in a library or coffee shop, and so you won't have the same level of guidance you'll get once you join us on campus. For now, we encourage you to connect with your classmates via Slack, a real time messaging application you'll be using in class.

### Set Up Slack

* First, check your email for an invitation from your producer.  Look for the name of the chat channel for your class in the email.
* When setting up slack, add a photo, your name, and "FEWD Student - CITY" to your profile.
* Next, go to [slack.com](https://slack.com/signin), enter the team domain from your producer's email, and join the channel from your producer's email to connect with classmates!
