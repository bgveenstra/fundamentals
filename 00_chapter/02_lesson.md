#### Units & Lessons

This ebook is split into units. Each unit contains a mixture of lessons and exercises to help you practice new concepts and tools.

* Every unit has objectives at the beginning. These are the most important takeaways from the unit; pay special attention to these goals as you go through the content.

* Every unit has a cheatsheet at the end.  The cheatsheet summarizes important information from the unit, but many developers find it helpful to take their own notes as well.

* In this interactive ebook, you'll get a deeper understanding of how the web works, explore some tools developers use, and learn fundamentals of three programming languages - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  These are the languages of the web's front end.
