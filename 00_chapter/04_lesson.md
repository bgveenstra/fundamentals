**Welcome to FEWD Fundamentals**

## Projects and Exercises

### Projects

#### About Me site

Throughout the fundamentals, you'll be applying new skills to build an "About Me" website. There are detailed instructions for how to complete a step of the project in each unit. You'll be asked to submit your "About Me" site when you start the FEWD course.

#### Dash Projects

In addition to the About Me project, you'll be comepleting some project from General Assembly's "Dash" series.  Dash includes step-by-step guides to set up a website. We'll link you to Dash projects that mirror the steps you might take for your About Me project.


### Exercises

The About Me project will help you tie together all the skills you learn in Fundamentals.

We also want you to be able to practice each skill as you go, so this ebook is interactive!  In most units, you'll find practice exercises using a web-based text editor that allows you to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without leaving the page.


#### JS Bin

The text editor inside this book is called JS Bin, and you can see an example below. You can click the various tabs (HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT) to open or close the corresponding file.

Clicking OUTPUT opens or closes the OUTPUT column.  The OUTPUT column displays or "renders" your work as it would look in a web browser.  

The CONSOLE tab is for JavaScript, so we'll use it more when we get to the JavaScript portion of fundamentals.


<a class="jsbin-embed" href="https://jsbin.com/zojica/embed?html,output&height=600px">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a><script src="https://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.min.js?3.35.12"></script>


1. Click through the tabs in the JS Bin above to get used to the navigation.

2. Try changing the content of the page by changing the code in the HTML tab. Check the results of your changes in the OUTPUT column.

**Note**: If one of the JS Bin editors doesn't load, or if you just see `JS Bin on jsbin.com`, simply refresh the page to try loading the JS Bin again.

### Getting Help

#### Additional Resources

Shhh. Ok, we're going to let you in on a little secret. Ready?

The exercise answers are at the back of the book :) That's right. If you're stuck, we've supplied exercise solutions to help you work backwards and understand what needs to be done.
