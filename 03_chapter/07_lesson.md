#### Linking our Files

We've gotten really far with learning about HTML and CSS. But how does the CSS file communicate with HTML file? When we use JS Bin, the text editor does some work in the background (invisible to us) to connect the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  When we're writing code from scratch, there are a few simple steps required to connect different types of files.  In order for an HTML file to pull in the proper CSS file, you're going to have *link* the two! Let's find out how.

<div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;"><iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/6nenlcostv?seo=false&videoFoam=true" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="100%" height="100%"></iframe></div></div>
<script src="//fast.wistia.net/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script>


>**Note** **Relative vs. Absolute Addressing**: Relative addressing basically tells your browser: “Look in our project folder for the file specified. Or, if the reference starts with a folder name, look within that folder for the file specified.”
On the other hand, when we link to a source outside of our project, the reference is referred to as an absolute address.
