# About Me Site

In this unit we've already introduced some of the core fundamentals of web development, including how the internet works as well as how websites are structured.

With this knowledge, you can start your About Me site. The goal of this exercise is to build the primary structure of your website.

## Exercise

Set up the foundational HTML for your About Me site.

##### Below are the steps to complete the assignment.

1) Open up Sublime Text Editor.

2) Create a new file called index.html

3) Set up your HTML boilerplate code.

2) Add a `title` element so the name of the your page shows in the browser tab.

3) Create a level one heading tag and add your name inside it.

4) Add a few paragraphs with information about you. We'd love to see a paragraph about your background, a paragraph about your motivations for working on front end web development, and a paragraph that describes a potential project idea

5) Add second level headings that describe the content of your paragraphs.

6) Add any contact information you'd like to provide. Use anchor tags for links and email addresses.  You'll eventually publish this site on the web, so you may want to add links to public information like your LinkedIn, Twitter, or Dribble.
