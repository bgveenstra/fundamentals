#Working with Images

Your website can really come to life with images! When you’d like to add images to your site, you should use the tag with the **src** attribute. `src` stands for “Source” and works just like the tag’s `href` attribute. It tells the image tag where to find the image you  want to include on your page. Learn how to add images with the next video.

### Breaking down the Image Tag

The *image tag* alone doesn't do much. It's like putting an empty `<a>` in your code. It needs some helpful attributes to do stuff. The most important thing is to tell the browser what image to show! That's what the *source attribute* does. The **src attribute** in an image tag works just like the href attribute in a link. It tells a browser where to look for a thing.

```html
<img src="">
```

The *image alternate attribute* (`alt`) describes the image. Programs called screen readers read this description out loud to people with visual impairments. It's extra-important when there's text in an image.

```html
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/z9gGd0t.jpg" alt="grumpy cat">
```


The *image title attribute* tells search engines what this image is a picture of. It helps you appear in Google Image Search.

```html
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/z9gGd0t.jpg" alt="grumpy cat" title="grumpy cat">
```
