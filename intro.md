Dear FEWD Student,

Congratulations on joining the Front-End Web Development program at General Assembly!

To make sure you have the proper footing to be successful in FEWD, we've prepared this ebook covering the fundamentals of web-based programming.

We'll cover **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**.  We'll also learn how to work with some standard developer tools (Text Editors and Browsers).

We expect it to take you around **6 hours to complete** this interactive ebook.
